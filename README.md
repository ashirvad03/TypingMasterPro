TypingMaster Pro
High-Performance Desktop Application for Typing Proficiency
TypingMaster Pro is a robust desktop application developed using JavaFX. It provides a structured environment for users to enhance their typing speed and accuracy through adaptive learning algorithms and interactive modules.

Project Overview
The application is designed to bridge the gap between utility and engagement. By implementing real-time tracking of WPM (Words Per Minute) and Accuracy, the software provides instantaneous feedback to the user. The project utilizes a modular architecture, ensuring scalability and efficient resource management.

Core Modules
1. Zen Practice Mode
Adaptive Text Generation: Generates dynamic sentences based on the user's current skill level.

Visual Feedback System: Features a virtual keyboard overlay that provides real-time highlights for keystroke validation.

Session Tracking: Calculates performance metrics including WPM and Accuracy percentage per session.

2. Meteor Gaming Mode
Concurrent Word Processing: A survival-based module where the user must process and type falling string literals (meteors) before they reach the boundary.

Difficulty Scaling: Automatically increases velocity and word complexity based on the user's score progression.

3. Custom Sound Engine
Themed Audio Feedback: Integrated support for multiple audio profiles including Mechanical, Typewriter, and Sci-Fi themes to enhance the tactile feel of typing.

Technical Specifications
Language: Java 17+ (Optimized for Java 21/25)

Framework: JavaFX (MVC Architecture)

Build System: Apache Maven

Deployment: Standalone Portable Executable (packaged via jpackage)

Installation and Usage
The application is distributed as a portable standalone package, eliminating the requirement for a pre-installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on the host machine.
